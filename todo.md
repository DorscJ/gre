- [ ] Go through punchlist for each article
- [ ] Get province information into general province page (somehow)
- [ ] Get keywords into tags list in header (as in bancroft example)
- [ ] Get geographic regions into sidebar using categories list (as in bancroft)
- [ ] Put `lead:` in the header for each article to make loglines/subtitles
- [ ] Check that all keywords are in controlled vocab (Programmatically)
- [ ] Figure out why there are so many unattached images (e.g. Achaea Nemea)
- [ ] Deal with empty stuff in headers
