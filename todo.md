# Article Punchlist

- Title in title case with spaces?
- Province `relref` correct?
- Location
  - folder `relref`
  - Pleiades ID
- Keywords, separated by newline (`\` at end of line)
- Sublocation `relref` present? -> comment out for now
- Pleiades ID
  - Numbers in link?
  - `"(Pleiades)"` in link? -> delete
  - Two links present, one with `relref` -> delete `relref`
- figures linked correctly?
- check all `ref`s to other gardens, should be `relref`s

# Articles in need of a second look

- achaea/athens/athens_neoplatonic..., no author
- achaea/corinth/corinth_circus, images with no links
- achaea/eua/villa..., editor seems to be author, no editor/author listed
- achaea/athens/athenian_schools, need to make sure this info gets in the right places
- ger sup/dietikon, no orcid for Christa Ebn√∂ther
- ger sup/vallon, two map images are broken, replace with new


# Image cropping and straightening

- [x] achaea
- [ ] britannia
- [ ] dacia_traiana
- [ ] dalmatia
- [ ] germania_inferior
- [ ] germania_superior
- [ ] macedonia
- [ ] pannonia

# Pompeii Notes/Issues

- Titles (I.ii.10). Right now if a location doesn't have a specific name, using the I.ii.10 ID.
- [x] Artifacts: TBD on how to note
- [x] Green (additions to entries?). What to do? There appears to be ORANGE now as well.
- [x] Add span style color families to new green parts of entries.
- [ ] Someone should relook over the bibs to see if they know what book the author is referring to, as I can't figure it out with just an author last name.
- [ ] Insula relref I don't know if we want these, but if we do the way I have them are probably wrong.
- [ ] Image PATHs might need modifying.
- [x] Note to self: relook over entries and add [statue] keyword.
- [x] Note if it has literary evidence/artifacts.
- [ ] Issue: I have found a entry that is House of Epidius Fortunatus (I.iii.3) and another that is I.iii.3. If there is a distinction, should we make it clearer?
- [x] *Aedicula lararium* added as one keyword merged from the two currently listed.
- [ ] Should I include excavations dates in date section?
- [x] Province edits for keywords
