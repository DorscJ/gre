# Province
Germania inferior

## Province Description
The Augustan military zone along the lower [Rhine](link) was formally reorganized as the province of Germania Inferior, Lower Germany, during the reign of [Domitian](link) around A.D. 85. Until this time, the area had been on the eastern fringe of the province of [Gallia Belgica](link). The provincial capital was [Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium](link) (modern Cologne). Numerous legionary and auxiliary bases fortified the lower Rhine frontier throughout its history. Lower Germany was bounded by the [Rhine](link) river in the north, and immediately south of this border lay marshy lowlands and the islands in the delta of the Rhine, [Meuse](link), [Waal](link) and [Schelde](link) rivers. Northbound ships carrying goods from the interior crossed over from the delta to [Britain](link). The province extended in the west beyond the [Meuse](link) River, and ended in the south at the [Vinxtbach](link) river. The sandy soils of the northern lowlands were of poor quality for cultivation, but they were well suited to cattle and horse breeding. The loess regions to the south, particularly to the west of the Cologne basin, on the other hand were ideal for agriculture, particularly cereal cultivation. The middle part of the province between [Nijmegen](link) and [Krefeld](link) was characterized by gentle wooded hills. The rugged [Eifel](link) and [Ardennes](link) mountains in the south and south-east of the province were mined for ores and stone of varying kinds. During the reign of [Domitian](link) (A.D. 284-305), the provincial boundaries were redrawn to extend westwards into areas formerly belonging to [Gallia Belgica](link). The province in its late phase was renamed Germania Secunda.

# Sublocation

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description
This *villa rustica* was built on a slope so that the residential building (A on Plan 1) overlooked the rest of the lower lying farmyard (Image 1). The entire complex covered an area 120 m. in width and 250 m. in length (3 hectares). The house was separated from a large open area behind and to the southwest of it by a wall. This has been interpreted as a utilitarian garden (G on Plan 1), and it may well be that an orchard and a vegetable garden were located here near the house.  

To the northeast of the house was an open courtyard flanked by outbuildings and separated from the service area of the farm by a terrace wall. This open courtyard may have been a garden (G on Plan 1), perhaps of a more decorative nature. Without any physical evidence for gardens, however, this remains speculation.
