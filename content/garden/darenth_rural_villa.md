## Garden Description

Excavations at this site of a Roman villa in Kent uncovered a large rectangular masonry pool in the courtyard, which was enclosed by buildings on the north, west, and east (Fig. 1). The villa buildings took up an area of 150 x 225 meters in total, including the courtyard with a width of 26.5 meters. Occupation at the site began after A.D. 100 and continued until the closing decades of the 4th
century.

This pool (P in Fig. 1), measuring 25.6 x 3.36 meters, lay at right angles to the center of the main
residence and bisected an enclosed courtyard, possibly a garden (G in Fig. 1) in front of the house. The
pool would have been a decorative element in the courtyard. Within the pool at the end nearest the
house was found a small bronze water-spout in the form of the head of a lioness. At the other end was a semi-circular pool with provision for the inflow and outflow of water.

South of the western range of rooms was a large, open space measuring 14.6 x 58.4 meters, enclosed by walls. There was no paving in this area, nor was there any evidence for partitions. It has been suggested that this might have been a kitchen garden (G in Fig. 1).
