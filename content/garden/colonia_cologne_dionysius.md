# Province

Germania inferior

## Province Description
The Augustan military zone along the lower [Rhine](link) was formally reorganized as the province of Germania Inferior, Lower Germany, during the reign of [Domitian](link) around A.D. 85. Until this time, the area had been on the eastern fringe of the province of [Gallia Belgica](link). The provincial capital was [Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium](link) (modern Cologne). Numerous legionary and auxiliary bases fortified the lower Rhine frontier throughout its history. Lower Germany was bounded by the [Rhine](link) river in the north, and immediately south of this border lay marshy lowlands and the islands in the delta of the Rhine, [Meuse](link), [Waal](link) and [Schelde](link) rivers. Northbound ships carrying goods from the interior crossed over from the delta to [Britain](link). The province extended in the west beyond the [Meuse](link) River, and ended in the south at the [Vinxtbach](link) river. The sandy soils of the northern lowlands were of poor quality for cultivation, but they were well suited to cattle and horse breeding. The loess regions to the south, particularly to the west of the Cologne basin, on the other hand were ideal for agriculture, particularly cereal cultivation. The middle part of the province between [Nijmegen](link) and [Krefeld](link) was characterized by gentle wooded hills. The rugged [Eifel](link) and [Ardennes](link) mountains in the south and south-east of the province were mined for ores and stone of varying kinds. During the reign of [Domitian](link) (A.D. 284-305), the provincial boundaries were redrawn to extend westwards into areas formerly belonging to [Gallia Belgica](link). The province in its late phase was renamed Germania Secunda.

## Location Description

This large town on the west bank of the Rhine river was the *civitas* capital of the [Ubii](link) in the first half of the 1st century A.D. It was granted the status of colonia by [Claudius](link) in 50 and became the provincial capital in 85.  

# Sublocation

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description
The largest urban villa excavated thus far in Cologne is the House of Dionysos (3400 sq. m.), named after the early 3rd century mosaic floor decorated with Dionysiac motifs in the triclinium (Image 1). The house occupies part of an *insula* in the northeastern corner of the city, bordered on the south by a street leading to the harbor.  

The original house, erected after A.D. 50, was rebuilt under [Vespasian](link) and included a peristyle garden courtyard measuring 23 x 27 m. (G on Plan 1). The garden was surrounded on three sides by a peristyle, 3.35 m. in width. A ground level gutter ran around the edge of the garden. At this time, a masonry pool with a paved floor occupied a position in the eastern part of the garden. A piece of lead pipe and a bronze opening were found associated with the pool. This was later replaced in the second half of the 2nd century by an apsed pool (4.20 x 5.40 m.) in the western half of the garden which drained into the gutter at the west. The pool was axially arranged between the entrance to the house on the east and the dining room on the west, from which a view through a wide doorway onto the garden was afforded. The triclinium was unheated, leading the excavator to interpret it as a summer triclinium. The connection with the garden would, in this case, be quite understandable. An axial planting pattern in the garden with a path leading from the entrance of the house to the pool is possible. There is, however, no evidence for the planting pattern or the type of vegetation in this garden. The house was inhabited until the 4th century.
