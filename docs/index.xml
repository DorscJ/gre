Location Chester
Garden Tomb Painting
Keywords funerary buildings tombs
Garden Description Toynbee’s suggestion that a military tombstone from Chester depicting a row of three gabled buildings with stylized trees or shrubs planted in front of the two at the sides perhaps represents a tomb garden with tomb and flanking funerary buildings, though plausible, cannot in itself be taken to show that tomb gardens existed in Roman Britain; it would, however, suggest that the concept of planting at tombs was regarded as conventionally Roman and appropriate.</description>

      <description>Province Britannia
Location Chedworth
Garden Rural Villa
Keywords balnea
mosaics (visual works)
sherds
villae rusticae
Garden Description This Roman villa in Gloucestershire was partially excavated in the late 19th century, but only the built features and their mosaic floors appear to have been of interest to the Victorian diggers. Excavations in the courtyard conducted between 2000 and 2002 revealed that earlier excavators had not disturbed the courtyard.
Parts of the villa may date to the early 3rd century A.</description>

      <description>Province Britannia
Province Description After Caesar’s campaigns in Britain in 55 and 54 BC, the southern part of the island lay within Rome’s sphere of influence. It was not until the Claudian invasion in 43 AD, however, that Britain was annexed as a Roman province, although the ‘conquest’ of Britain in the west and north continued and proceeded slowly in the decades thereafter. Apart from a brief interlude in the mid-2nd century, when the northern border of the province was fixed at the Antonine Wall in Scotland, from the 120&amp;rsquo;s the northern frontier of the island lay on Hadrian’s Wall stretching from the west to the east coast.</description>
