# To begin the proccess, set out certain criteria for determining archaeological vs. literary gardens

## Here are two criteria I came up with that would denote a literary garden vs an archaeological one:

* [x] A citation for an author *(Pausanias, Strabo, etc.)* vs. mentions of excavations
* [x] The absence bibliography *(to suggest that the entirety of the descrition is written soley using the evidence presented by the author, and not an external source)* vs. bibliography
* [x] No plans *(that would be difficult to obtain should the garden description be of literary origin)* vs. having plans

## So now onto evaluating each of the gardens for these two features:

### Aegina

#### Temple Grove - Literary

* [x] Features Pausanias *and* Pindar
* [x] No bibliography
* [x] No plans 

### Athens

#### Urban Houses near the Areopagus - Archaeological

* [ ] No mention of any primary source
* [ ] A full bibiolgraphy
* [ ] Two figures, one of which is a plan

#### Palace of the giants - Archaeological

* [ ] No mention of a primary source author
* [ ] Includes a bibliography
* [ ] A plan

#### Gymnasia and Groves - Literary *and* Archaeological

* [x] Mention of Pausanias *and* excavations
* [ ] Includes a bibiography
* [ ] Includes plans
